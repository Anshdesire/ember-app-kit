## Overview

Ember App Kit (EAK) is a robust starter kit for developing applications in [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com). EAK makes it easy to develop, build, test, and deploy applications independent of any back-end build process.

The kit is the result of the hours application developers have put into setting up tooling.

### Asset Compilation

Ember App Kit is built around [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), an extremely easy-to-use task runner built in Node.js. Grunt is the *de facto* build tool of the front-end world, and EAK uses its huge ecosystem of tasks for compiling all kinds of assets, including:

* Handlebars templates (or [Emblem](http://emblemjs.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) (or [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), or [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), or [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)...)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* Minified JS & CSS

All of this compilation happens in the background while you're developing, rebuilding each time you change a file.
