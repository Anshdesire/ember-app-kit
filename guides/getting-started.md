### Installing

Ember App Kit's primary build tool is [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), a build tool written in Node.js. If you don't already have Node installed, you can get it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) or your package manager of choice (including [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on OSX).

Once you've installed Node, you'll need to install the Grunt command-line tool globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`. After that, clone the repo or [download it as a zip](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/archive/master.zip) to get started with the template.

In the folder for your new project, run `npm install` to install the dependencies Grunt relies on to build. Once your dependencies are installed, you should be able to simply run 

`grunt server` 

and navigate to 

[http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000)

to see your new app in action.
