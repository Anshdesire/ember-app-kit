### Managing Dependencies 
Ember App Kit uses bower for dependency management. Bower configuration file is located at the root of your EAK project `../bower.json` 

Dependencies can be installed by executing: 
`bower install`

Further documentation about bower is available at their [official documentation page](http://bower.io/).
